# Data Science Projects
### 1. **Kodluyoruz - Data Science for Public Good - Decision Tree Homework**
    
I performed preprocessing and model building operations with the decision tree on the [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) data in Kaggle.

### 2. **Inzva - Applied AI Study Group #5 - Recommender Systems Homework**
    
I developed a model recommending movies using cosine similarity on [The Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data) data in Kaggle.

### 3. Classifying Skin Cancer

I developed a model classifying skin lesions as benign and malignant using NasNet on [Isic Challenge Dataset - 2019](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)

### 4. Develop k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier in Python From Scratch
I implemented k-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm in python from scratch using [iris.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jbrownlee/Datasets/master/iris.csv) dataset.
