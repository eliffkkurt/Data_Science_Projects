# Data Science Projects
## 1. **Kodluyoruz - Data Science for Public Good - Decision Tree Homework**
    
I performed preprocessing and model building operations with the decision tree on the [House Prices](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data) data in Kaggle.

## 2. **Inzva - Applied AI Study Group #5 - Recommender Systems Homework**
    
I developed a model recommending movies using cosine similarity on [The Movies](https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data) data in Kaggle.

## 3. Classifying Skin Cancer

I developed a model classifying skin lesions as benign and malignant using NasNet on [Isic Challenge Dataset - 2019](https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data/)

## 4. Develop k-Nearest Neighbors Classifier in Python From Scratch
I implemented k-Nearest Neighbors Classification Algorithm in python from scratch using [iris.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/iris) dataset.

## 5. An Introduction to Statistical Learning Book
After studying the theoretical parts of the [An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R](https://web.stanford.edu/~hastie/ISLRv2_website.pdf) book, I answered the applied questions at the end of each chapter with python.
### Chapter 2 
**ISLR - Chapter 2 - (Exercises,Applied,Question 8)**

I performed data exploring and data visualization operations using matplotlib and seaborn libraries on [College.csv](https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/data.html) dataset.

**ISLR - Chapter 2 - (Exercises,Applied,Question 9)**

I performed data exploring and data visualization operations using seaborn library on [Auto.csv](https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/data.html) dataset.

**ISLR - Chapter 2 - (Exercises,Applied,Question 10)**

I performed data exploring, anomaly detection, data visualization operations using sklearn, matplotlib, seaborn library on [Boston.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/prasadperera/the-boston-housing-dataset/data?select=housing.csv) dataset.

### Chapter 3 
**ISLR - Chapter 3 - (Exercises,Applied,Question 8 and 9)**

I created simple linear regression and multiple linear regression on [Auto.csv](https://book.huihoo.com/introduction-to-statistical-learning/data.html) dataset and performed below operations using statsmodels, scipy, matplotlib and seaborn libraries.
-	Prediction of the confidence interval and prediction interval of the response based on a given variable value,
-	Evaluating the relationship between the predictors and response based on model’s statistical values (like R-squared, F-statistic, Prob (F-statistic), p-value, coefficients),
-	Displaying least-squares regression line,
-	Plotting the residuals, studentized residuals, and the leverages,
-	Fitting linear regression models with interaction effects,
-	Trying a few different transformations of the variables, such as log(X), √X, X2.

### Chapter 5 
**ISLR - Chapter 5 - 5.2 The Bootstrap**

I created a notebook where I explain step by step what the bootstrap is and I performed bootstrapping operations using scikit-learn library on [Advertising.csv](https://www.kaggle.com/ashydv/advertising-dataset) dataset.

### Chapter 6 
**ISLR - Chapter 6 - 6.4 Considerations in High Dimensions**

I created a presentation in which I explain the considerations in high dimensional datasets.
